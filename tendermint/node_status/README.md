# status
This system will alert you with telegram about jails and inactive status. Also it sends you every hour short info about your node status.

Instruction:

1. Create telegram bot via `@BotFather`, customize it and `get bot API token` ([how_to](https://www.siteguarding.com/en/how-to-get-telegram-bot-api-token)).
2. Create at least 2 groups: `alarm` and `log`. Customize them, add your bot into your chats and `get chats IDs` ([how_to](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32423837/telegram-bot-how-to-get-a-group-chat-id)).
3. Connect to your server and create `status` folder in the `$HOME directory` with `mkdir $HOME/status/`.
4. In this folder, `$HOME/status/`, you have to create `cosmos.sh` file with `nano $HOME/status/cosmos.sh`. You don't have to do any edits on `cosmos.sh` file, it's ready to use.
> You can find `cosmos.sh` in this repository.
5. In this folder, `$HOME/status/`, you have to create `cosmos.conf` file with `nano $HOME/status/cosmos.conf`. Customize it.
> You can find `cosmos.conf` in this repository.
6. Also you have to create as many `NAME.conf` files with `nano $HOME/status/NAME.conf`, as many nodes you have on the current server. Customize your config files.
> You can find `pylons.conf` and `curl.md` in this repository.
7. Install some packages with `sudo apt-get install jq sysstat bc -y`.
8. Run `bash cosmos.sh` to check your settings. Normal output:

```

```

9. Add some rules with `chmod u+x $HOME/status/cosmos.sh`.
10. Edit crontab with `crontab -e`.
> You can find `crontab` in this repository.
11. Check your logs with `cat $HOME/status/cosmos.log` or `tail $HOME/status/cosmos.log -f`.
